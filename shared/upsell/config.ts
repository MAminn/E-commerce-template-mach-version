/**
 * Upsell configuration — the single source of truth for how a product's
 * recommendations are chosen.
 *
 * A product carries one `upsell_mode`:
 *
 *  - `global`   — follow the store-wide default (random recommendations).
 *                 Every existing and new product starts here, so the owner
 *                 never has to configure products one by one.
 *  - `manual`   — show exactly the products the admin picked, in their order.
 *                 The list is the product's existing curated add-ons
 *                 (`best_layered_with_ids`); no second relation exists.
 *  - `disabled` — no upsell for this product anywhere.
 *
 * The store-wide switches live in `store_settings.upsell_config`. A row saved
 * before a field existed inherits that field's default here, so new fields
 * never need a data migration.
 *
 * This is a recommendation system only. Nothing here touches prices,
 * discounts, promo codes, offers or checkout.
