-- Additive: product upsell mode + store-wide upsell settings.
--
-- upsell_mode defaults to 'global' (the store's random recommendations), so
-- every existing product works without being edited. The manual list is the
-- existing best_layered_with_ids column — no new relation is introduced.
--
-- Products whose owner already curated add-ons are switched to 'manual', so
-- that curated list keeps being what those products recommend instead of
-- being replaced by random picks. The UPDATE only touches rows still on the
-- column default and is a no-op for products with an empty list.
--
-- upsell_config is nullable; a NULL row means "use the shipped defaults"
-- (shared/upsell/config.ts), so nothing needs backfilling there.
--
-- FORMATTING: shared/database/auto-migrate.ts splits this file on the
-- statement-breakpoint marker and DISCARDS any chunk beginning with a SQL
-- line comment, so this header ends with its own breakpoint and each
-- statement below stands alone.
