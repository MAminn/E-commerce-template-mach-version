/**
 * A random seed that lives for the browser session.
 *
 * Sent with every upsell request so the server's random order for a product
 * is the same each time this shopper opens it during the session — the
 * recommendations do not reshuffle on a reload or a back-navigation. A new
 * session gets a new order.
 *
 * Storage can be unavailable (private mode, blocked site data); the seed then
 * lives in memory for the page's lifetime, which is still stable for the
 * interaction that matters.
