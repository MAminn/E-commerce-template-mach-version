 * customer activity — that has to be an explicit act in the admin, never
 * something a deploy switches on by itself.
 *
 * `eligibleStatuses` excludes `pending` and `cancelled`: a pending order is
 * an unconfirmed intent (this store has a staging COD order sitting in that
 * state), and a cancelled one is a purchase that did not happen. Neither is
 * social proof.
